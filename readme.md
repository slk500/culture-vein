The base functionaliy of this app it's my 'id√©e fixe' but I like try new things & fool around a little bit so 
my apology for being inconsistent in design.     

Right know as a part of experiment I'm trying to remove OOP objects on use only functions.

To run project:
1. run command in public_html 'php -S localhost:8000'
2. run command in frontend 'ng serve' 
3. run database docker run -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_DATABASE='mysqldb' -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD='yes' -d mysql
4. import database from db dir
